I am a chef with 4 years of experience, looking to change career to software engineering. I have been studying software engineering, coding in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Ruby On Rails and more. I am always trying to be better as a worker, a developer, and as a person by continuously studying and practicing. I have many more skills and abilities that I would love to exercise, If I am successful in my application I am available to negotiate a start date for 2023.
